     <p>A middle stage html prototype for the landing page. Apologies for the N00dz joke. It wasn't mine. I ultimately replaced that placeholder text with something like "The easiest way to securely share ____" and an array that dropped different classes of items in order to help suggest use cases to our potential users.<p/>
     <p><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/portfolio/opal-array-500.png" alt=""></p>
     <p> An earlier HTML prototype. This has an example of the array, I mentioned above, although with bad formatting. It also has more polished copy than the middle stage prototype. If I remember correctly, the copy here was actually pretty polished, but it was too text heavy. I was trying too hard to compensate for a lack of assets at this point and had to focus on ways to present the problem and solution in an informative manner that didn't overwhelm visitors and distract from our sign up form.</p>
     <p><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/portfolio/message-500.png" alt=""></p>
     <p>This screenshot shows someone replying to a message in their inbox in our the web-based prototype. It looks pretty straightforward, but there was an issue with the composition field obstructing the original message - making it difficult for the user to reference the earlier message.</p>
      <p><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/portfolio/mobile-dash.png" alt=""></p>
      <p>This is a concept for the dashboard on our mobile app. One problem with encrypting information is it makes running searches difficult. Our research suggested that users were good at recalling where information was based on it's relationship to other data and who sent it to them. So, while threads were difficult to track down when they were broken up by subject, it was easy to find all conversations with the appropriate user and scroll back through messages until they found what they were looking for.</p>

        <h3>Opal</h3>
        <hr>
        <p><a href="http://opal.io">Opal</a> was a secure messaging and file sharing startup based in Los Angeles, CA. During our private alpha, which ran from August 2013 - January 2014, Opal was acquired by Google.</p>
        <p>I joined Opal at the time of founding as the first non-founding member.</p>
        <p>I did competitive and user research, produced low fidelity mockups, worked on user flows, and did some design work on the landing page and blog. I also wrote most of the marketing copy and edited the team&#8217;s blog posts.</p>
