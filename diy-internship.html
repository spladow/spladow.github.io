            <br>

            <p class="centered">(The to-do list currently in production)</p>
            <p>To-Do's began as a way to address the fact that it was becoming harder for our members to navigate the skills page and keep track of the challenges they wanted to tackle as the catalogue of skills grew to well over 100. The team was really excited at the opportunity to re-introduce the forking feature here as well. We thought we could have members mark either challenges or individual projects "To Do". If they picked a user's project, the forked version would be linked to the original through our commenting system and the original poster would get a notification. Ultimately, there were some rough edges on some of the forking flows and we decided to scale back the feature, but structure it in a way that it would be able to accomodate forking in a later release. You can see this reflected in the move toward project images for the challenges and less emphasis on skills and badges.</p>
            <div><img class="img-responsive illo" src="assets/img/diy/todo/to-do-w-remix.png" alt=""></div>
            <p>One of the early problems I had with forking was that kids can submit projects to multiple challenges in different skills. It's not uncommon to see someone submit a project that completes three or more challenges and we wouldn't know which project a member intended to complete with thier forked version. I was using a lot of real estate trying to support these mega projects. There were debates about whether we really wanted to support completing multiple challenges with one project at all and the impact that decision had on our moderation process.<p>
            <div><img class="img-responsive illo" src="assets/img/diy/todo/shared-todo-copy.png" alt=""></div>
            <p>Once we decided to shelf forking and focus on the single use case of planning activities, it became clear that to-do lists could easily take advantage of the metadata we were using to power the activity guides we show parents and educators who had signed up for our Extra Awesome features. We had interviews with parents that showed us one of the things they liked most about the site was that they could point their kids to it when they were bored and they would find something to do. We decided to minimize the friction between logging in and finding a project by showing time and cost estimates. Kids could go to their to-do lists with no real plan and find a project they could hop into easily, as well as see the more ambitious projects they'd marked as interesting so they could start getting the materials together for next time.</p>

                <li>kids on DIY don't have many other social networks/social graphs. No importing, no real names. They are usually telling eachother exactly what their username is. So we don't have a lot of names that come back. It's not like you know your friend's name is Alex and you can sort through all the people named Alex. Not a lot of overlap. (Unless your name has minecrafter in it.) So I revised the results for people to only show a few at once.</li>

        <hr>
<p>After <a href="diy.html">running a usability study</a> around some of <a href="http://diy.org">DIY</a>'s core actions and social features for my Masters program, I spent the summer interning in their San Francisco office.</p>

<p>While there, I worked on the service's moderation tools, designed a new to-do feature, and took a new search experience through wireframes before I had to return to Seattle.</p>

<p>DIY was an incredible, eye-opening experience for me. I grew a lot as a designer and got some great insights into my strengths and weaknesses.</p>
